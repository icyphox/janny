JANNY

A work-in-progress Kubernetes application to clean up Kubernetes
resources after a set TTL.


ROADMAP

[x] Implement basic resource cleaning
[ ] Black/whitelist resources
[ ] Expiry timestamp
[ ] Helm chart


DEVELOPING

Setup a local minikube cluster[1]. Then, clone this repo and install
dependencies:

    $ poetry shell
    $ poetry install

Build a docker image (gets stored in minikube's registry):

    $ eval $(minikube env-docker)
    $ docker build -t janny:latest .

Finally, deploy to your cluster:

    $ kubectl apply -f deploy/deployment.yaml

Note: Absolutely nothing works at the moment, so don't even bother.


PRIOR ART

https://codeberg.org/hjacobs/kube-janitor: While kube-janitor already
does the same thing, it's written using pykube, which has been
undeveloped since 2017.
